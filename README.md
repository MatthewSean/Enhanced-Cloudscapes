# Enhanced-Cloudscapes
A freeware volumetric cloud replacement add-on for X-Plane 11

Personal build.

Changes:

1: changed texture creation to nearest filter, to help remove sparkles on edges.
2: Fixed plugin depthbuffer creation (no long a blank texture). Doesn't look to fix the issues with depth.
3: Added a bicubic filter in post processing shader swicthable with the bicubic_sampling dataref.
